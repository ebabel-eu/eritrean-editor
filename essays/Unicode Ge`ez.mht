<H3>Motivation</H3>
<P>Making Eritreans more comfortable with computers and computer-based=20
information will be a crucial element of bringing the benefits of the =
Internet=20
and computers to the average Eritrean.=20
<P>Limited access to technology (and the enhanced productivity it =
brings) is one=20
of the main barriers to raising the standard of living and the value of =
national=20
economic production in Eritrea. The ease of computer access, and the =
relevance=20
of computer information will be a major element of rapidly transferring =
and=20
applying computer technologies to Eritrea's economic and productive =
activities.=20
<P>The for-profit private sector development model for multi-lingual =
computer=20
infrastructure has failed Eritrea. First of all there are very few =
multi-lingual=20
software providers and developers in Eritrea (there are approximately =
two), and=20
the software that has been developed is expensive, uses non-standard =
character=20
encodings, and is mutually incompatible with other software in Eritrea =
and=20
Ethiopia. Prices for existing software range from $20 to $90 per copy =
and there=20
were no free versions of the software until UniGeez began free =
distribution.=20
This had lead to the contradiction that English-speaking people can use=20
computers in their own language for free, while Tigrigna speakers (who =
have a=20
mean per-capital of $250/year) may have to pay $90 to use a computer in =
their=20
own language.=20
<P>The large public benefits of multi-lingual computer access means that =
basic=20
utilities that provide easy multi-lingual computer access should be =
public,=20
rather than private property. A person trained and proficient in =
computers has=20
an earning potential of perhaps 2-10 times that of a person without =
computer=20
training. This means that if the existence of free public multi-lingual =
computer=20
utilities facilitate computer access to just 1000 more people, the =
national=20
economic benefit will be at least 1000 people*$1000/yr =3D $1 =
million/year. This=20
justifies significant pulbic sector investment in the development of =
basic=20
multi-lingual computer infrastructure.=20
<P>To this end the Eritrea Technical Exchange Project of the =
International=20
Collaborative for Science Education and the Environment (ETEP/ICSEE) has =
a=20
project to develop and enhance the basic multi-lingual Ge`ez (g'Iz) and =
Arabic=20
computer facilities and infrastructure in Eritrea. All multi-lingual =
utilities=20
developed by ETEP will be public property software distributed under the =
<A=20
href=3D"http://www.gnu.org/">GNU public license</A>.=20
<H3>Technical Issues</H3>
<P>There are several technical issues that will be important for =
establishing an=20
efficient multi-lingual computer communications infrastructure in =
Eritrea.=20
<P>The most important technical issue is how to consistently encode or =
represent=20
Ge`ez and Arabic text strings and formatted documents. Fortunately this =
problem=20
has been largely solved already through the international =
standard-setting=20
process. There are a set of standards commonly referred to as the =
Unicode=20
standards, or more technically known as ISO/IEC 10646-1. These standards =

describe with technical specificity how to encode characters of most of =
the=20
world's languages, including the Ge`ez syllabary. These standards =
include=20
"Ethiopic" in Amendment 10, which even though it is mis-named includes =
all=20
letters of the Ge`ez syllabary. Details of the Unicode standards are =
available=20
at the <A href=3D"http://www.unicode.org/">Unicode Home Page</A>.=20
<P>But the setting of an international standard for the encoding of =
Ge`ez is=20
just a first step. Once the encoding standard is set, fonts that comply =
with the=20
standard need to be designed and computer software need to be developed =
that=20
allows users to create computerized information content that complies =
with the=20
standard. To date, there is only on unicode-compliant true type Ge`ez =
font (<A=20
href=3D"ftp://ftp.ethiopic.org/pub/fonts/TrueType/gfzemenu.ttf"> GF =
Zemen=20
Unicode</A>) though there are several unicode compliant Unix/Linux =
fonts. And=20
until recently there has not been any Windows keyboard software that =
complies=20
with the international encoding standards. As a result, there are about =
70=20
mutually incompatible Ge`ez encodings in use in both Eritrea and =
Ethiopia.=20
<P>Another rather large task for enabling an efficient multi-lingual=20
infrastructure is providing configuration and software modification =
support so=20
that common applications can and do utilize and display standard =
compliant Ge`ez=20
documents and data. There remains a lot of work to be done in this area =
with=20
regards to graphic design and database software.=20
<H3>Why Standard Compliance?</H3>
<P>The efficiency and productivity of computer communications depends =
directly=20
on the speed and cost of transfering information from one person or =
application=20
to another. Currently, in the U.S. the largest amount of time is spent =
in=20
gettting information is not the network transfer, but locating and =
reading the=20
information. Perhaps it takes 15 seconds to go to a search engine, a =
minute to=20
find the page in the search engine results, and another minute to read =
the=20
information. If documents are not prepared in a consistent encoding and =
format,=20
then an other step may have to be taken to read or use information that =
is in=20
Ge`ez because of the need to convert or translate the character encoding =
between=20
formats. That step, even if it takes less than a minute, can increase =
the time=20
of presenting or retrieving information by up to 30%. In addition, =
developers=20
and content providers would have to spend extra resources to provide =
translation=20
and conversion facilities for different types of Ge`ez. Even worse, =
after=20
standards become dominant, the cumulative archives of non-standard Ge`ez =

documents will have to be converted to be useful. A reasonable estimate =
of the=20
costs of conversion and conversion support in a computer communications=20
environment without standards is about 10% of computer communications =
activity.=20
<P>Current computer communications markets in Eritrea are running at =
more than=20
$200,000 per year and doubling at about 100%/year. The computer services =
sector=20
is probably 5 to ten times this amount. This means that the cost of=20
non-compliance with standards can be tens to hundreds of thousands of =
dollars=20
per year in the near future. Mostly this cost is reflected in the lost=20
opportunities of people using English letters and text when they would =
be much=20
happier and effective in using Ge`ez or Arabic if it was convenient and =
readily=20
available.=20
