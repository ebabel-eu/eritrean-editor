<H2><A name=3D"Why Late"></A><B>Why the Internet is so late in coming to =

Eritrea.</B></H2>Eritrea will be one of the last countries in the world =
to have=20
a live Internet connection. This is largely due to three factors: scarce =

resources, a small population, and a cautious nationalist development =
style.=20
<P>Eritrea has one of the lowest per-capita income levels in the world, =
variably=20
estimated between $150 and $250 per person per year. The literacy rate =
is about=20
20%, and the local languages are Arabic and Tigrigna which have scripts =
that are=20
not easy to use on computers as yet. The scarce resources means that =
there are=20
few computers (perhaps 10,000 to 30,000 in the country---less than one =
for every=20
100 people), few people can use them, and there little money to pay for =
Internet=20
services. Secondly, by having a small population of about 3 to 4 million =
people,=20
and a small computer market, there is not the demand necessary to have a =
large=20
Internet services market that allows providers to develop economies of=20
scale.&nbsp; And third, with Internet services being potentially =
expensive, and=20
with the country short of resources, the government is hestitant to =
subsidize=20
advanced communications infrastructure that will be used by very few=20
Eritreans.&nbsp; The Eritrean government wants to make sure that =
Internet=20
development contributes to the national development process rather than =
using up=20
scarce technical and financial resources.=20
<P>As a result of the above-mentioned challenges, a favorable policy and =

economic context for Internet services is just not available. The =
markets don't=20
have much money or demand for Internet services, and the government is=20
justifiably skeptical of the national benefits of Internet development.=20
<P>But in spite of questions regarding the true benefits of Internet, at =
the=20
beginning of 1999, the Eritrean Communications department solicited =
license=20
applications from local businesses for Internet service provision.&nbsp; =
In=20
addition, in August 1999, the Eritrean government signed a memorandum of =

understanding with the U.S. Agency for International Development =
regarding=20
assistance for the establishment of Internet in Eritrea through the =
Leland=20
Initiative.&nbsp; But even with official sanction and support of =
Internet=20
development, there are many details and difficulties with regards to =
actually=20
bringing effective services to Eritreans.&nbsp; This article discusses =
some of=20
these more detailed issues and challenges.=20
<H2><A name=3DMotivation:></A><B>Motivation: Is Internet good for=20
Eritrea?</B></H2>
<P><BR>In order to properly bring Internet connectivity to Eritrea it is =

necessary to first be clear on the reasons for Internet connectivity and =

Internet services.=20
<P>For many Internet users there is no question that the Internet is a =
good=20
thing.&nbsp; It is not even a debateable issue for them. The average =
information=20
addicted netizen, will say "Of course the Internet is good for =
Eritrea...It=20
brings information, and information is power and money...which Eritrea =
needs!"=20
While for many in Eritrea the question seems irrelevant: 95% of =
Eritreans have=20
no computer access, and even if they had computer access they may never =
afford=20
Internet access. So who cares?=20
<P>The assumption of the analysis in this paper, is that there are three =

requirements which if met, will make Internet services feasible and =
highly=20
desireable in Eritrea.=20
<P>The first requirement is that Internet is a good investment: That is =
if makes=20
good business sense and makes money without subsidy, then it is just =
plain good=20
business. If Internet services make money on their own without any =
subsidy, then=20
they are contributing to Eritrea's economic growth and development.=20
<P>The second requirement is if the Internet is accessible to almost any =

Eritrean with access to a computer and a modem no matter what their =
economic=20
level, then it is good for Eritrea.&nbsp; If information resources are =
more=20
available to Eritreans, then it decreases the monopoly power that =
foreigners and=20
foreign institutions have on information and information =
resources.&nbsp; This=20
makes Eritreans and Eritrean businesses more competitive relative to =
their=20
foreign counterparts.=20
<P>The third requirement for Internet in Eritrea is that it strikes an =
optimal=20
balance between price and performance for the average user--delivering=20
reasonably good service at a low price if possible.=20
<P>We assume that if these three requirements are met, then there will =
be a=20
consensus that Internet connectivity is good for Eritrea.=20
<P><I>(There are other concerns like people accessing objectionable or=20
pornographic content. These problems are very easy to solve technically =
by=20
setting access restrictions at the international connection. Policy is =
more of=20
the question with those issues)</I>=20
<P>We of the Eritrea Technical Exchange (a non-profit support project in =

California, USA), wish to present for Eritrea and Eritreans, some of the =
details=20
of&nbsp; how the Internet can and will be brought to Eritrea.&nbsp; The =
ETE is=20
working to assist Internet connectivity in a way that will completely =
fulfill=20
the three requirements and resolve most questions and concerns about =
Internet=20
access in Eritrea.=20
<P>The main innovations of the activities that we are supporting include =
the the=20
following:=20

<H2><A name=3DBackground:></A>Background: Email in Eritrea</H2>The =
Eritrea=20
technical exchange currently provides the best, most efficient, and cost =

effective email connectivity services for Eritrea. Even though we =
utilize long=20
distance phone calls that cost up to US$1.50 per minute, email is =
exchanged with=20
Eritrea at an operational cost of less than three cents per page of text =
(retail=20
prices in Eritrea are of course higher). This is a remarkable feat, =
especially=20
considering that it costs nearly 100 times as much to send a 1-page fax =
from=20
Eritrea to the U.S. The low cost and efficiency of Eritrea's email =
system has=20
made it fairly accessible to a wide audience that includes hundreds of=20
<I>(perhaps over one thousand)</I> users. These users include university =

students, private individuals, business people, and government officials =

(including the news and information agencies).=20
<P>Our organizational model for such email development combines foreign=20
volunteer technical support, and local commercial operation of the =
system by=20
national businesses. A second component of the model, has been to =
use--at least=20
initially--some margin from the commercial sale of email services to =
subsidize=20
access for public or selected governmental institutions.=20
<P>At first, there were doubts of whether or not email was good or even =
legal in=20
Eritrea. But the success and efficiency of the email system in practice =
has=20
resolved these doubts. Some of this involved showing people throughout =
the=20
public sector that email was a good and useful service. This was done by =

providing people with free email accounts for a period so that they =
could see=20
its benefits.=20
<P>Like with email,&nbsp; Internet-mediated information access and =
distribution=20
is several times more efficient and cost effective for certain types of=20
applications.&nbsp; And once Internet is demonstrated in a way that is =
sensitive=20
to the national interests of Eritrea, there will be consensus that =
Internet is=20
good for the country.=20
<H2><A name=3D"Questions of"></A>Questions of Equality</H2>But in spite =
of its=20
success, there remain valid concerns regarding the distribution and =
access to=20
computer communications services in Eritrea. Very few people have email =
access.=20
And Internet access may be much more expensive than simple email. It is =
not=20
clear that the existence of Internet will benefit more than a very small =
group=20
of rich foreigners, and large businesses. How can the Eritrean people =
benefit=20
from such an expensive and high-tech undertaking?=20
<P>Furthermore, Eritrea may take pause from Ethiopia's experience with =
Internet=20
development. The service there was soon oversubscribed, and it has been =
plagued=20
by slow performance, high cost, and low efficiency.=20
<H2>Analysis of&nbsp;<A name=3D"Ethiopia's Internet =
Problems"></A>Ethiopia's=20
Internet Problems</H2>Fundamentally, the problems experienced in =
Ethiopia are a=20
reflection of the distortions in the local economy and the inequalities =
in=20
people's incomes. The income disparity between the poorest sector of the =
user=20
base (for example University students) and the richest sectors (foreign=20
businesses) is a factor of one hundred. So an unhappy compromise must be =
made=20
between cost and performance. This compromise satisfies almost nobody. =
The=20
foreigners who are willing to pay more for good performance, can't get =
the=20
performance they demand, because the average user can't pay that price. =
The=20
average potential user may be willing access the system only at night, =
or with=20
low priority, but they cannot afford access because the price is too =
high. So=20
everybody pays a relatively high price for something with relatively =
poor=20
performance. And the system is structured so that they have no other =
choice=20
except to make an expensive international phone call to an outside =
service=20
provider.=20
<P>The Ethiopian solution to the Internet access problem is far from =
optimal.=20
The reason is that average price/performance is poor, and there is only =
a few=20
price/performance options in an economically very diverse market. The =
solution=20
is to increase the overall performance of the system (through efficiency =

improvements), and to provide a wide economic range of Internet use =
options for=20
the local market. These solutions can and should be included in =
Eritrea's=20
implementation of Internet.=20
<H2><A name=3D"International Internet"></A>Internet Connections: How do =
they=20
work?</H2>Before we go into the details of how to make an Internet link =
work=20
well, we need to review the basics of how an Internet link works.=20
<P>The Internet is a type of Wide Area Network or WAN. What a WAN does =
is=20
deliver packets of information or data to potentially distant computers =
over a=20
wide range of interconnected computer networks. These networks may be of =
widely=20
different types. But technical standards and rules have been developed =
for the=20
delivery of such packets. These standards make the efficient operation =
of WAN's=20
possible. The standard or protocol used on the Internet is called TCP/IP =
which=20
stands for the Transmission Control Protocol/ Internet Protocol.=20
<P>Computers can be either directly or indirectly connected to the =
Internet.=20
Indirectly connected computers use an intermediary, or "proxy" computer =
to get=20
data from the Internet on their behalf. Directly connected computers =
must have a=20
unique IP (or Internet Protocol) address which is a series of four =
numbers, each=20
between 0 and 255 noninclusive.=20
<P>National Internet connections must have at a minimum two components. =
One is=20
the local Internet Service Provider that provides the different servers =
and=20
computers that the users use for calling in, storing and retrieving =
email,=20
hosting web sites, etc. And the other is the Network Backbone Provider. =
This is=20
the institution that provides the international data connection, and =
central=20
network management.=20
<P>For Eritrea, the international connection can come in several forms. =
One form=20
may be an international leased line such as a 64 kilobit/second voice =
channel,=20
or a VSAT connection. Alternatively the International connection can be =
provided=20
through a simple dial-up connection using regular phone lines, or a =
roaming=20
dialup connection through an international ISP that provides such =
roaming=20
services (such as iPass).=20

<P>In calculating these costs, we make the following assumptions.&nbsp; =
For=20
phone lines, we have about a 2.5 kilobyte per second transfer rate at =
$1.50 per=20
minute, which leads to 400 seconds or 6.7 minutes of transfer which is a =
little=20
over $10 per Megabyte. Call set-up and other inefficiencies can increase =
this to=20
$20 per Megabyte.=20
<P>For international roaming services we assume a low quality connection =
of=20
about 1 kilobyte per second (or less) which means 1000 seconds or 17 =
minutes of=20
transfer is needed which is $4 at the low end and up to $10 per Megabyte =
if=20
there are other inefficiencies such as a degraded connection.=20
<P>For private VSAT, the cost would be $10,000 to $20,000 per month for =
a 128=20
kbps private connection typically. This is about $0.23 per minute.&nbsp; =
But at=20
most such a connection would be used at 30% of capacity so we would get =
a=20
transfer rate of&nbsp; 1000 Kilobytes /[(128 kbps/8bits/byte) X 30%] =
=3D&nbsp; 200=20
seconds or 3.3 minutes/Megabyte transfered. This means that for a =
well-utilized=20
line the cost would be about $0.6 per Megabyte transfered.=20
<P>For a leased international voice channel, it is assumed that such a =
line=20
would be provided on a cost recovery basis by the telecom authority. =
With such=20
an assumption the line would be about $2000/month, or about $0.05 per=20
minute.&nbsp; A 64 kbps line can download at about 8 kilobytes per =
second but=20
for a leased connection it would likely be used at less than 30% =
capacity so it=20
would take 1000 Kilobytes/(8 kilobytes/sec X 30%) =3D 400 sec =3D 7 =
minutes or $0.35=20
per Megabyte.=20
<P>So it can be seen that depending on the type of international data=20
connections that is available, and the efficiency with which it is used, =
the=20
cost of transfering data from the Internet to Eritrea can vary by a =
factor of=20
50.=20
<P>Currently, for the email system, the bandwidth costs account for=20
approximately 30% of the retail price of the email services in =
Eritrea.&nbsp;=20
Other costs are effectively the technical service, capital recovery, and =

administrative operational costs of system administration and service =
